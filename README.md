# Brush - universal splats

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f55b9c-8632-49f9-b34b-d5de52a7a8b0

Brush is a 3D reconstruction engine, using [Gaussian splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). It aims to be highly portable, flexible and fast. 3D reconstruction shouldn't require special hardware. Brush can render and train on a wide range of systems: **macOS/windows/linux**, **AMD/Nvidia** cards, **Android**, and in a **browser**. To achieve this, brush is built using WebGPU compatible tech, that can run practically anywhere! It uses the [Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) framework, which has a portable [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) backend. This project is currently still a proof of concept, and doesn't yet implement any of the extensions to gaussian splatting that have been developed, nor is the performance optimal yet.

## Features

The demo can load pretrained ply splats, and can load datasets to train on. Currently only two formats are supported. A .zip file containing:
- A transform_train.json and images, like the synthetic nerf scene dataset.
- An `images` & `sparse` folder with [`COLMAP`](https://github.com/colmap/colmap) data

While training you can interact with the splats and see their training dynamics live, and compare the current rendering to training / eval views as the training progresses.

While training, additional data can be visualized with the excellent [rerun](https://rerun.io/). To install rerun on your machine, please follow their [instructions](https://rerun.io/docs/getting-started/installing-viewer). Open the ./brush_blueprint.rbl in the viewer for best results.

# Why

Machine learning for real time rendering has a lot of potential, but at the same time, most popular ML tools don't align well with r. Rendering requires low latency, usually involve dynamic shapes, and it's not pleasant to attempt to ship apps with large PyTorch/Jax/CUDA deps calling out to python in a rendering loop. The usual fix is to write a seperate training and inference application. Brush on the other hand, written in rust using `wgpu` and `burn`, can produce simple dependency free binaries, and can run on nearly all devices.

# Getting started
Install rust 1.81+ and run `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`. You can run tests with `cargo test --all`. Brush uses the wonderful [rerun](rerun.io) for additional visualizations while training.
It currently requires rerun 0.19 however, which isn't released yet.

### Windows/macOS/Linux
Simply `cargo run` or `cargo run --release` from the workspace root.

Note: Linux has not yet been tested but *should* work. Windows works well, but does currently only works on Vulkan.

### Web
This project uses [`trunk`](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk) to build for the web. Install trunk, and then run `trunk serve` or `trunk serve --release` to run a development server.

WebGPU is still a new standard, and as such, only the latest versions of Chrome work currently. Firefox nightly should work but unfortunately crashes currently.

The public web demo is registered for the [subgroups origin trial](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5126409856221184). To run the web demo for yourself, please enable the "Unsafe WebGPU support" flag in Chrome.

### Android
To build on Android, see the more detailed README instructions at crates/brush-android.

### iOS
Brush *should* work on iOs but there is currently no project setup to do so.

## Technical details

Brush is split into various crates. A quick overview of the different responsibilities are:

- `brush-render` is the main crate that pulls together the kernels into rendering functions.
- `brush-train` has code to actually train Gaussians, and handle larger scale optimizations like splitting/cloning gaussians etc.
- `brush-viewer` handles the UI and integrating the training loop.
- `brush-android` is the binary target for running on android, while `brush-desktop` is for running both on web, and mac/Windows/Linux.
- `brush-wgsl` handles some kernel inspection for generating CPU-side structs and interacing with [naga-oil](https://github.com/bevyengine/naga_oil) to handle shader imports.
- `brush-dataset` handles importing different datasets like COLMAP or synthetic nerf data.
- `brush-prefix-sum` and `brush-sort` are only compute kernels and should be largely independent of Brush (other than `brush-wgsl`).
- `rrfd` is a small extension of [`rfd`](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/rfd)

### Kernels

The kernels are written in a "sparse" style, that is, only work for visible gaussians is done, though the final calculated gradients are dense. Brush uses a GPU radix sort based on [FidelityFX](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx.html) (see `crates/brush-sort`). The sorting is done in two parts - first splats are sorted only by depth, then sorted by their tile ID, which saves some sorting time compared to sorting both depth and tile ids at the same time.

Compatibility with WebGPU does bring some challenges, even with (the excellent) [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu).
- WebGPU lacks native atomic floating point additions, and a software CAS loop has to be used.
- GPU readbacks have to be async on WebGPU. A rendering pass can't do this unless the whole rendering becomes async, which has its own perils, and isn't great for an UI. The reference tile renderer requires reading back the number of "intersections" (each visible tile of a gaussian is one intersection), but this is not feasible. This is worked around by assuming a worst case. To reduce the number of tiles the rasterizer culls away unused tiles by intersecting the gaussian ellipses with the screenspace tiles.

The WGSL kernels use [naga_oil](https://github.com/bevyengine/naga_oil) to manage imports. brush-wgsl additionally does some reflection to generate rust code to send uniform data to a kernel. In the future, it might be possible to port the kernels to Burns new [`CubeCL`](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl) language, which is much more ergonomic and would allow generating CUDA / rocM kernels. It might also be possible to integrate with George Kopanos' [Slang kernels](https://github.com/google/slang-gaussian-rasterization).

### Benchmarks

Rendering performance is expected to be very competitive with gSplat, while training performance is still a bit slower. You can run some benchmarks using `cargo bench`. The performance of the splatting forward and backwards kernel are faster than the _legacy_ gSplat kernels as they use some new techniques for better performance, but they haven't been compared yet to the more recent gSplat kernels. End-to-end training performance is also still slower, due to other overheads.

For additional profiling, you can use [tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) and run with `cargo run --release --feature=tracy`.

### Quality

Quality is similair, but for now still somewhat lagging behind the original GS implementation. This is likely due to some suboptimal splitting/cloning heuristics.
